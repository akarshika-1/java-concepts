The major advantage of method/constructor reference is code re-usability.

If we want to use method/constructor reference then both methods/constructor should have same argument types.

Syntax for method reference :
static method->   class name :: method name
instance method->   object reference :: method name

Functional interface can refer both lambda expression and method/constructor reference.
