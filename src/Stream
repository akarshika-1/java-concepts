If we want to process objects from java_8.Collection, then we can use stream.

In java 8, stream() method is present inside java_8.Collection interface as default method.

Filtering :
If we want to filter elements from a java_8.Collection based on some boolean condition,
then we should go for filtering by using filter() method of java_8.Stream interface.

Mapping :
If we want to create a new object for every object present in a java_8.Collection based on some function,
then we should go for mapping by using map() method of java_8.Stream interface.

Processing by collect() method :
This method collects the elements from the stream and add to the specified java_8.Collection.

Processing by sorted() method :
We can use to sort method inside stream.
1- sorted() method is used for default natural sorting order.
2- sorted(Comparator c) method is used for customized sorting order specified by comparator object.

Other methods are min(), max() and count()

Processing by forEach() method :
This method wont return anything.
This method can take lambda expression as an argument and apply that lambda expression for each element
present in stream.

Processing by toArray() method :
This method is used to copy elements present in the stream into specified array.

java_8.Stream.of() method :
We can also apply this method for group of values and for arrays.
